Quintain is primarily targeted at admins and maintainers whose main interaction
with web-apps is rebasing local patches on upstream releases and revisions, and
deploying to live servers in the least-invasive manner.

This started life as a couple of highly case-specific scripts, which I have now
rewritten in the hopes of it being useful as a more generic tool. This
iteration is presently a "works for me" release:

 1. It's had very little testing since I abstracted and rewrote it for public
    release, so there's bound to be at least 1 or 2 typos introduced somewhere
 2. It presently handles one use-case (git-based repos, debian-based servers)
 3. It is very under-documented

Having said that, I successfully use the pre-rewrite versions of the two main
scripts for regularly updating and live-deploying code to production & staging
servers for a ~90MB public-facing web-platform, handling regular local and
upstream code-changes from multiple participants.
